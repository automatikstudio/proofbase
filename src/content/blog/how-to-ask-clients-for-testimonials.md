# How to Ask Clients for Testimonials (Templates and Scripts Included)

You know you need testimonials. They're the most powerful form of social proof — 92% of consumers read them before making a purchase decision. But asking feels awkward, right?

Here's the truth: **happy clients want to help you.** They're grateful for the work you did. They just need to be asked — and given an easy way to respond.

This guide shows you exactly how to ask for testimonials in ways that feel natural and get results, including templates you can copy and use today.

## Why Clients Don't Give Testimonials (Without Being Asked)

Even your happiest clients won't volunteer testimonials because:

1. **They're busy** — Writing takes time they don't have
2. **They don't know what to say** — "It was great" doesn't feel substantial
3. **They don't know you need them** — Testimonials aren't on their radar
4. **They forget** — Life moves on after project completion
5. **It feels weird** — They're not sure of the format or process

Your job is to remove these barriers. Make it easy, guide them, and ask at the right time.

## When to Ask for Testimonials

Timing is everything. The best moments:

### 1. Right After Delivery (Best for Service Businesses)

Strike while the satisfaction is fresh. When you deliver final work and the client is excited, ask immediately.

**Why it works:** Emotions are high, details are fresh, goodwill is at its peak.

**Best for:** Freelancers, agencies, consultants

### 2. After a Specific Win or Milestone

Wait until you can point to results:
- "You just hit 10,000 subscribers using the strategy we built..."
- "Your website traffic has doubled since launch..."
- "You closed your first client using the proposal template..."

**Why it works:** Testimonials with specific results are more credible.

**Best for:** Long-term clients, measurable outcomes

### 3. During Positive Conversations

When a client compliments your work unprompted:
- "So glad you said that — would you mind if I quoted you on that?"
- "That means a lot! Any chance you could write that in an email I could use as a testimonial?"

**Why it works:** They've already done the hard work of formulating praise.

**Best for:** Any situation where praise is offered naturally

### 4. At Project Wrap-Up (Formal Close)

Build testimonial requests into your process. At the final meeting:
- Review what was accomplished
- Ask for feedback
- Transition to testimonial request

**Why it works:** It's expected, professional, and doesn't feel like an imposition.

**Best for:** Project-based work with defined endings

## How to Ask: The Right Approach

### Be Direct, Not Apologetic

**Don't say:**
"I hate to bother you, and I know you're super busy, but if you have time at some point, maybe you could possibly write something..."

**Do say:**
"I'd love to feature your success story on my website. Would you be willing to write a short testimonial about our work together?"

Confidence is attractive. If your work was good, asking is reasonable.

### Explain Why It Matters

Clients are more likely to help when they understand the impact:

"Testimonials from clients like you help other business owners trust that they'll get real results. It would mean a lot to have your voice on my site."

### Make It Easy

Offer options:
- Written testimonial (email response)
- Video testimonial (2 minutes, smartphone is fine)
- LinkedIn recommendation (they can copy it to you)
- Quick phone call (you'll write it up for their approval)

The easier you make it, the more likely they'll do it.

### Provide Guiding Questions

"What should I say?" kills more testimonials than anything. Give prompts:

- What was your main challenge before we worked together?
- What specific results have you seen?
- What would you tell someone considering working with me?
- What stood out about the experience?

These questions lead to substantive, compelling testimonials.

## Email Templates for Requesting Testimonials

### Template 1: Right After Project Completion

**Subject:** Quick favor — could I feature your story?

---

Hi [Name],

It was such a pleasure working on [project] with you. Now that we've wrapped up, I wanted to ask a small favor.

Would you be willing to write a short testimonial about our work together? It doesn't need to be long — 2-3 sentences is perfect.

If it helps, here are a few questions to get you started:
- What was your main concern before we started?
- What results or improvements have you seen?
- Would you recommend working with me to others?

Feel free to reply directly to this email with your thoughts. I'd be honored to feature your story on my website.

Thanks so much,
[Your name]

### Template 2: After a Specific Result

**Subject:** Congrats on [specific win] — quick question

---

Hi [Name],

I saw that [specific achievement — e.g., you hit 10K followers, landed a new client, launched successfully]. Congratulations! That's awesome to see.

I'm reaching out because I'd love to feature your story as a case study / testimonial on my website. Your results are exactly what potential clients want to see.

Would you be open to sharing a few sentences about:
- Where you were before we worked together
- What we did together
- The results you've achieved

No pressure at all, but if you're willing, just reply here and I'll take it from there.

Either way, congrats again!

[Your name]

### Template 3: Follow-Up (After No Response)

**Subject:** Re: Quick favor — could I feature your story?

---

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my earlier note about a testimonial. I know you're busy, so I wanted to make this as easy as possible.

Would you be comfortable with this approach? I'll write a draft based on our conversations, and you can approve, edit, or scrap it — no pressure.

Let me know if that works, and I'll send something over this week.

Thanks!
[Your name]

---

### Template 4: Permission to Quote (After Verbal Praise)

**Subject:** Can I quote you?

---

Hi [Name],

During our call, you said something that really stuck with me:

"[Their exact words or close paraphrase]"

Would you be okay with me using that as a testimonial on my website? I'd include your name and [company/role].

If you'd prefer to tweak the wording, happy to update. Just let me know!

Thanks,
[Your name]

## The "Write It For Them" Strategy

Many clients want to help but won't prioritize writing. Offer to ghostwrite:

1. **Ask for permission:** "Would you prefer I draft something based on our work together for your approval?"
2. **Write the testimonial:** Use their words from conversations, emails, and feedback
3. **Send for approval:** "Here's what I put together — feel free to edit or rewrite entirely"
4. **Get sign-off:** A simple "Looks good!" is your green light

Most clients will approve with minimal changes. You've done the heavy lifting.

## Video Testimonial Tips

Video testimonials are 2x more credible than text. But they feel intimidating. Make it easy:

- **Keep it short:** "60-90 seconds is plenty"
- **Smartphone is fine:** "Just prop up your phone and hit record"
- **Provide exact questions:** Send 3 specific prompts
- **Offer to edit:** "I'll clean it up and add your logo"
- **Remove production pressure:** "Authentic beats polished"

Script for clients:
"Could you record a quick 1-minute video answering: What problem did you have before? What did we do together? What's different now? Just use your phone — I'll handle the rest."

## Where to Use Testimonials

Once you have them, use them everywhere:

- **Website homepage** — Feature 2-3 strongest testimonials prominently
- **Service/product pages** — Match testimonials to relevant offerings
- **Proposals and pitches** — Include 1-2 relevant testimonials
- **Social media** — Share as quote graphics
- **Email signatures** — Rotate a featured testimonial
- **Case studies** — Expand into detailed success stories

## Building a Testimonial System

Don't rely on memory. Build testimonial collection into your process:

1. **After every project:** Send your testimonial request email
2. **Track in a spreadsheet:** Who you asked, when, status
3. **Follow up once:** If no response in 7 days
4. **Store and organize:** Keep testimonials in a master document
5. **Rotate usage:** Refresh your website testimonials quarterly
